The goal of this project is to create an app to display flight data in a 3d virtual environment

This app has no intrisic value to add 
It is merely a goal to direct my learning as i embark deeper into computer programming.
Also it might look good on my CV in the future as a way to show off my skills in data magement and visualisation and such.

Topics of interest with regards to this project

Data Visualisation in 3d
3d model
App design
Using the VR and AR functionality in phones
Creating a HUD in an app form
Launching Mobile Apps
API

Best of luck to myself.
